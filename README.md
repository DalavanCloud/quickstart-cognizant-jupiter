## Jupiter on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys Jupiter on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Jupiter is Cognizant’s continuous data testing accelerator and a component of Cognizant’s Adaptive Data Foundation offering. Jupiter enables data test automation and quality engineering at scale by aligning to a DevOps delivery mode. You can use Jupiter to run quality-assurance tests on data in the AWS Cloud on data systems such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift, or Apache Hive on Amazon EMR.

The deployment is automated by an AWS CloudFormation template and takes about one hour. The Quick Start automates the design, setup, and configuration of hardware and software to implement automated data testing in much less time than with traditional approaches. Spend less time writing tests with libraries that connect, run queries, and validate data across heterogeneous systems.

Once you’ve deployed Jupiter on the AWS Cloud, you can:
- Configure databases and sources that Jupiter will test.
- Configure source code management (SCM) repositories for deploying test scripts to configured environments.
- Run data validation tests on an Amazon EMR instance.
- View a dashboard that provides information about the most recent test run.
- Try a set of sample template test projects with sample datasets for Amazon S3 and Apache Hive.
- Integrate Jupiter with defect-management tools like Jira or HP Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) to enable traceability.
